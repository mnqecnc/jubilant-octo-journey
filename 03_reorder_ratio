CONCLUSION: While smoothies aren’t making a lot of money for SpeedySpoon, they have a very high reorder rate. 
That means these smoothie customers are strong repeat customers.
Instead of recommending smoothies be taken off the menu, we should talk to the smoothie customers and see what they like so much about these smoothies. 
There could be an opportunity here to expand the product line, or get other customers as excited as these kale fanatics.
